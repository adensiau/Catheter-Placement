🏥 Catheter Placement
Description
This project focuses on classifying catheter placements in X-ray images using deep learning. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to categorize catheter positions as normal, abnormal, or borderline. The goal was to assist in automated medical image analysis for improved clinical decision-making.
